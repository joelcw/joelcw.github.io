##Two Lessons Before Breakfast

This morning I walked out of the church in Kenora where we're sleeping, took a cup of coffee to a park bench, and sat down to do a little reading and a little silent worship. While I was sitting there, a number of likely houseless Anishinaabe men walked by me (I'm guessing about their economic status based on the potentially misleading fact that they seemed to be coming from a homeless shelter next door). I was sitting with bare feet, because it was a warm morning, and one man came towards me, saying "hey man, are you ok? Where are your shoes?!"

I told him they were in the church next door, where I was staying, and that I was just relaxing here. He said, "Oh, I just wanted to make sure you were ok. I thought you didn't have any shoes." I was struck by this considerate and loving statement, especially coming from someone who was materially much less well off than myself (Lesson 1). The event that followed did not make me feel that I had adequately returned his love.

I was sitting with a book and an e-reader on the bench next to me, and the Anishinaabe man came to sit down next to me and have a chat for a minute. As he sat down, I instinctively put my hand on the pile next to me and pulled it closer to myself; it was a reflex action, without any thought. He noticed this immediately (which was very observant, as it was a tiny movement of my hand), and said, "oh no, you don't have to worry about me." I was more ashamed than I can tell you: after he had shown me kindness, the last thing I wanted to do was anything to insult his integrity. It was highly embarrassing to me that the possessiveness and fear that I'd internalized in early life, due to my own privileged economic background, had emerged by reflex in this uncharitable way (Lesson 2). We chatted for a minute, and then he moved on. I won't ever forget him, though: this lesson means I have some work to do.

<!-- ##Undoing Colonialism

At least 6 hours of today were spent by the team undergoing an "undoing colonialism" training, led by an Anishinaabe person who identifies as Two Spirit in gender. We did a number of exercises to help us become painfully conscious of our own privileges, focussed on those of us that are from a North American white settler heritage. We also became painfully aware of how white settlers, and their power structures, systematically dismantled the Anishinaabe culture in this area.

One exercise had us and our belongings stand in for elements of traditional Anishinaabe culture, different ages, genders, roles in the community. Then, piece by piece, we were pulled apart and alienated from each other and our societal roles, until the culture and community were nearly unrecognisable,  and we were left with feelings of isolation, hopelessness, sadness, frustration, and anger. Among the things that were dismantled were traditional matriarchial aspects of Anishinaabe society (replaced by toxic patriarchial ideas, grafted on from settler expectations of men and women), and the erasure of non-binary gender, [Two Spirit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Two-Spirit) individuals. According to the little I learned today, these Two Spirit people were celebrated in their gender difference from prehistoric times, and often served a special role of healers, who could relate to multiple genders (and live with and love all of them). (See also the "Culture" section [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe)).

We learned far too much for me to summarize here, and most of it was emotional rther than intellectual. We leave today with a strong feeling of a richness of the Anishinaabe culture, how welcoming Anishinaabe people here (especially the workshop facilitator) are to our delegation, and a surreal sense of the intense pain that the deliberate and continuing extermination of their culture has caused. At the very least, we hope that the training today has increased the odds that, as we try to do our bit to halt that extermination, we can avoid doing any harm ourselves to the people here.-->
