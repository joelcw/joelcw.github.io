##Loomings

For some months now, I've had the powerful intuition that a number of apparently unrelated groups of people share an important thing in common: they fall into some highly stigmatized category, and have to deal with mental health professionals, mental health charities, and/or other members of the medical community (broadly defined) relating to their stigmatized circumstances or conditions. Here are the communities I have in mind: Trans/Genderqueer/Gender-nonconforming people who need to deal with medical professionals regarding gender in some way, LBGP people who deal with the same professionals regarding sexuality, addicts/alcoholics, people suffering from depression, anxiety, or PTSD (especially with PTSD related to sexual assault or other "domestic" violence).

Connecting these different communities may be a wild idea, but I think they share the following in common, and so would be natural allies:  

1. Frequent interaction with (sometimes poorly trained/prepared) mental health professionals.
1. Lots of stigma.
1. I suspect that people under one of these categories often show up under another one, too (though this is currently an intuition without data).

I would like to find a way to unite this diverse set of people and do the following: help direct members of these communities to the best services for them, and bring pressure to bear on the broad medical community to improve services in the relevant areas.

I've come up with three possible directions for a new movement to do this, which I outline below. At the moment, the third option seems to me to be the most feasible in the short term, but I would like to hear your opinions (via Twitter [@quakerscientist](https://twitter.com/quakerscientist)).

If a number of people get interested in one of the options I outline below, I'd hope to set up a board of trustees to run the project involving representatives from each of the stigmatized groups. Personally, I'm a recovered alcoholic, so that's the only community I can speak for or about out of personal experience (see my last post, below, for a little more discussion of that issue). I also come into this through having close friends or family who are in the other categories, but I would *never*, ever, ever, presume to speak for an oppressed group which I am not a member of.


##Clam or Cod


Assuming you're on board with me so far, we have some choices to consider with regard to strategy. Some are long-term and some are medium-term, but needless to say, none of these ideas are going to be particularly easy to execute. (I suppose that makes life more fun!)

1.  First, an obvious one: a political / direct action campaign aimed at improving mental health provision in the NHS (for the UK) and other health institutionds.  
(But campaign for what? Perhaps better education for people working in certain mental health roles, but this will be a long time in coming.)

2.  A very long game: supporting people from the communities we represent to actually go into mental health professions, to change them from the inside. For example, we could start a scholarship fund to help trans people afford training in medicine, counseling, biomedical research, etc. With enough time, this could have an impact, but it is a seriously non-trivial fundraising effort.

3.  Set up a website to serve as both a pressure-building campaign and an informational resource for our communities: a site where people can log their experiences with various physicians, clinics, hospitals, charities, etc., all over the world, and **rate** them online. We would need a numerical rating system and a place for prose comments, both of which would have to be moderated.

###More detail on Option 3

I've been getting excited about Choice 3, as a short/medium-term goal. If it works, the effect could be twofold: first, people who have to engage with one of the institutions on the list can find out what to expect (or where to go instead). Secondly, if it becomes a well-used and well-known system, the institutions and medical people themselves might be put in the position of competing for better ratings -- or at least, to not show up with really nastily bad marks.

For Choice 3 to work, we'd have to set up a rating system on a number of criteria, and think carefully about what questions we ask people to base their ratings on; e.g. good questions might be, "Did they treat you respectfully?", or "How well did they explain the purpose of the consultation and the role of the professional conducting it?"
(One might imagine examples of less useful questions.)

Two more goals for the rating system occur to me off the bat:

1. We might want to try some very creative interface to guide people through a series of questions to form their rating, where each question can build on previous ones and add more detail, so the resulting rating could represent a summary of a rich amount of information. This will also make sure the user understands what we are asking, as we can ask a series of things and explain as we go along.

2. **VERY IMPORTANT**: We do *not* want the rating system to feel like a chore. People in the above communities often have to fill out lots of forms, many of which inspire a great deal of anxiety (thank you to [@ShyScholar](https://twitter.com/ShyScholar) and [@100percentclass](https://twitter.com/100percentclass) for helping me understand this better). We do not want to be just another form for people to fill out.

**Possible Solution**: If the interface were more like a game, i.e. fun, informative, and *elegant*, then it might feel more like something people want to do. One could imagine having the series of rating questions presented in the form of a [Twine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twine_(software)) game, so that it is maximally interactive. As for elegance, a good example is the Twine collection of [@gersandelf](https://twitter.com/gersandelf)'s poetry and prose [here](http://gersande.com/notebook/) (these also have relevance to the issue of mental health, and are worth a read!).

The overall goal of the site might be to build on existing national databases of health care institutions, charities, etc., and use the experiences of user communities to distinguish between those institutions that understand our problems and have helped us to a healthy outcome, and those that didn't. The big investment here would be setting up a website, doing some basic research, and some non-trivial html coding. Ultimately, as more and more service users from the relevant communities interact with the site, pressure will build on those institutions with bad ratings to change their behavior.
(Note that we would have to build a significant user base for the number of ratings/comments to be statistically robust in representing the overall experiences for each community.)


##The Ship (Or, what we would need for Option 3)

1. A Board of Trustees (and/or researchers) which represents *all* of the communities I have mentioned (and any others you'd like included). I repeat: I represent one community at least, but I CANNOT GO IT ALONE here as I do not represent most of these communities.

2. A good programmer for the website (html and related coding). Hopefully this person could be employed by us, given:

3. Funds for a programmer and possibly some other part-time work, which should be gettable through a Kickstarter. (But I would like a programmer and Board of Trustees to be in place before we start raising any money, to prove the project is viable.)

4. A name. I thought of a cool acronym, which may not quite work: DATASeT, standing for: Depression, Anxiety, Trauma, Addiction, Sexuality, Transition (though perhaps "transition" isn't really the right description, and it should be something more like "gender"...).

Another name for the organisation might be "Hang Together", as I find the quotation we began with above to be fitting for our constituencies (with a certain morbid humor).

##All Astir

Please, please contact me via Twitter ([@quakerscientist](https://twitter.com/quakerscientist)) if you:  

* Have general comments about whether any of these are good ideas.
* Would like to be the programmer for Option 3.
* Would be interested being on the Board of Trustees.
* Have some better idea to accomplish the same goal (I would love it)!
